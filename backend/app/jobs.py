"""Job persistence.

This was an in-memory dict, which meant a server restart lost every job and the
rendered clips on disk became orphans nobody could list. It is now backed by the
database while keeping the original create/get/update interface, so the pipeline
code calling it did not have to change.

Each call opens and closes its own short-lived session on purpose: the pipeline
runs on a FastAPI background thread and updates progress many times per job, and
holding one session open across a multi-minute render would pin a connection and
risk stale reads.
